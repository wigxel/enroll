# Debugging CodeceptJS 4 Tests

Failures lie. The error usually points at a step that's a side effect of something earlier — auth expired, a frame switch missed, a network call still pending. Reproduce, capture state, and read it before fixing.

Two paths, picked by who's driving:

- **MCP-first (for AI agents)** — drive the test through the MCP server. In-test `pause()` and the `pauseAt: N` option on `run_test` both yield control back to the agent in-process — same `I` / browser the test is using. Inspect via `run_code` / `snapshot`, advance one step at a time via `run_step_by_step` + `continue`, release a pause via `continue`. `aiTrace` artifacts cover the prior steps.
- **CLI fallback (for humans / CI / framework internals)** — `npx codeceptjs run --debug` for verbose framework output. Escalate to `DEBUG="codeceptjs:*"` when the _framework itself_ looks at fault: recorder hangs, plugin races, event leaks, "step never ran". Use this path for CI repros, headless servers, and framework-internal bugs.

In-test `pause()` adapts to who's driving: at a TTY it opens the readline REPL; under MCP it yields control to the agent (same in-process `I` / browser); in a non-TTY non-MCP subprocess it prints a notice and resolves immediately so leftover `pause()` calls don't deadlock CI. **Adding `pause()` is now the primary MCP breakpoint** — drop it where you want to look, run via `run_test`, drive the live page through `run_code`, release with `continue`.

## Workflow

### 1. Read the project (fundamentals)

Run the **codeceptjs-fundamentals** skill. You need: helper, plugins on (especially `aiTrace`, `screenshot`, `pageInfo`, `retryFailedStep`, `pause`, `auth`), env vars, whether MCP is wired up. If `aiTrace` is **not** declared, add it **once** with `plugins: { aiTrace: { enabled: true } }` — most of this skill leans on its output.

**Declare `aiTrace` once; never edit config to change its trigger.** The capture mode is controlled per-run from the CLI, exactly like the `pause` plugin:

```bash
npx codeceptjs run -p aiTrace:on=step   # persist every step (default)
npx codeceptjs run -p aiTrace:on=fail   # persist only the failed step
npx codeceptjs run -p aiTrace:on=test   # persist only the last step of each test
npx codeceptjs run -p aiTrace:on=file:path=tests/login_test.js;line=43
npx codeceptjs run -p aiTrace:on=url:pattern=/checkout/*
```

`-p aiTrace:on=...` overrides the config-declared mode for that run only. Reach for `on=fail` to keep a CI repro lean, `on=step` while actively diagnosing. Don't flip `on:` in `codecept.conf.js` between runs — it churns the config and the change leaks into other runs.

### 2. Reproduce minimally

Run only the failing test, with steps printed:

```bash
npx codeceptjs run --grep '<scenario>' --steps
```

Add `--config codecept.ci.conf.js` if the failure is CI-specific. Confirm reproduction before instrumenting further.

### 3. Pick a path

**MCP (primary for AI agents):**

- `run_test <test>` — runs a specific test in-process; shares `I` / browser with `run_code` and `snapshot`. Returns the JSON reporter result on completion, **or** `{ status: 'paused', pausedAfter, page, suggestions }` if the test calls `pause()` or hits the optional `pauseAt: N` breakpoint. From a paused state, drive the live page via `run_code` / `snapshot` and release with `continue`.
- `run_step_by_step <test>` — interactive: pauses after every step. After each `continue`, the test advances one step and re-pauses (or completes). Use when you want to watch the whole flow tick by; use `run_test` with `pauseAt: N` instead for a single targeted breakpoint.
- `continue` — releases a paused test. After `pause()` or `pauseAt`: runs to completion (or to the next `pause()`). After `run_step_by_step`: advances one step.
- `run_code <CodeceptJS lines>` — runs arbitrary CodeceptJS code in the live session (works fresh **and** while a test is paused — same container). Returns the **value the code produced**, captures `console.log` / `info` / `warn` / `error` / `debug` output, and saves a final-state snapshot (URL, ARIA, HTML, screenshot, storage). Use to test a locator hypothesis or grab a value at the failure point.
- `snapshot` — captures current browser state without performing any action (URL, cookies, localStorage, HTML, ARIA, screenshot, console). Use between actions when you want to reason about what to do next without re-running anything.
- `list_actions` — sanity-check that an `I.*` method exists on the active helper.

**CLI (fallback):**

- `npx codeceptjs run --grep '<scenario>' --debug` — first move when MCP isn't available. Steps + helper internals + URLs + plugin events.
- `npx codeceptjs run ... --verbose` — adds promise-queue / retry / timeout logs on top of `--debug`.
- `DEBUG="codeceptjs:*" npx codeceptjs run ...` — turns on CodeceptJS's internal debug streams. Reach for this when `--debug` doesn't explain the failure: orphaned timers, event leaks, recorder hangs, plugin races, double-emitted events, "step disappeared from the queue". Narrow with namespaces: `codeceptjs:recorder` (promise queue), `codeceptjs:pause`, `codeceptjs:ai`, `codeceptjs:plugin:<name>`. Most user-level test failures don't need this — it's the framework-internal escape hatch.

### 4. Set a breakpoint with `pause()` or `pauseAt`

The MCP server installs an in-process pause handler at startup. Whenever a test running through `run_test` hits `pause()` (or completes the `pauseAt: N` step), control yields back to the agent on the same `I` / browser. There's no subprocess, no IPC, and `run_code` / `snapshot` work against the live page — exactly what a paused REPL would give you.

Two ways to land at a breakpoint:

- **In-test `pause()`** — drop `pause()` directly in the test where you want to look. Best when you're already editing the file or want to break inside a `within` / loop / hook.
- **`pauseAt: N` on `run_test`** — programmatic, no test edit required. Pauses after the Nth leaf step completes.

To pick `N`, list the steps with their indices:

```bash
npx codeceptjs dry-run --debug --grep '<scenario>' --numbers --no-ansi
```

Output is one numbered line per leaf step (1-based, per-test). The number on the line you want to stop _after_ is the value to pass as `pauseAt`. `--no-ansi` strips colors so the output is clean for parsing.

Once paused (`{ status: 'paused', pausedAfter, page, suggestions }`):

1. **Inspect with `run_code`** — `await I.grabCurrentUrl()`, `await I.grabWebElement(...)`, `await I.seeElement({ role: 'dialog' })`. Each call returns URL + ARIA + console + storage from the live page.
2. **Capture clean state with `snapshot`** between hypotheses — no action, just the artifact bundle.
3. **Walk earlier steps via `aiTrace`** — `output/trace_<TestName>_<hash>/trace.md` has the per-step state for everything that ran before the breakpoint.
4. **Release with `continue`** — runs to completion (or to the next `pause()`). For a step-by-step walk, use `run_step_by_step` instead of `run_test`; each `continue` then advances one step.

### 5. Read the trace

Hand off to **codeceptjs-run-analysis** to walk `output/trace_<TestName>_<hash>/trace.md` and the per-step artifacts. Focus on the **first** failed step — late failures are usually side effects of an earlier silent miss. The run-analysis skill also covers grepping into large HTML, clustering errors across many traces, and comparing reruns when flakiness is in play.

For locator-level questions on a saved snapshot ("would `.btn-primary` have matched here?", "is `Username` a field at step 7?") use **`codeceptq`** against the per-step `<NNNN>_<step>_page.html` — see the "Query trace HTML with `codeceptq`" section below. Faster feedback loop than `run_code` when you're iterating selector candidates.

### 6. Form a hypothesis

| Symptom                                 | Likely cause                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Element missing, page is `/login`       | Auth: stale `check`, expired session, missing env var            |
| Element in HTML but `display: none`     | `waitForVisible`, not `waitForElement`                           |
| Locator matches 2+ (strict mode)        | Disambiguate: ARIA role, `step.opts({ elementIndex })`, `within` |
| Element in screenshot N+1, missing in N | Animation / lazy load — `waitForVisible(loc, t)`                 |
| 401/403 in console.json                 | API token expired or env var missing                             |
| Steps pass, next `I.see` fails          | Frame switch missed — wrap in `within({ frame })`                |
| Different result CI vs local            | `setHeadlessWhen(CI)`, viewport, timing, env var                 |
| Recorder hangs, step never fires        | `DEBUG="codeceptjs:recorder"` to inspect the queue               |
| Plugin misbehaves                       | `DEBUG="codeceptjs:plugin:<name>"`                               |

### 7. Verify the fix on the live page

For agents driving MCP, use `run_code` to try the candidate fix in the live session **before editing the file**. If it works there, it'll work in the test. While paused (in-test `pause()` or `pauseAt`), `run_code` operates on the same `I` / browser the test is using, so a candidate replacement step can be tried in place. Humans running with `--debug` at a TTY can use in-test `pause()` for the same purpose at a readline REPL.

### 8. Apply and re-run

Edit the test, then `npx codeceptjs run --grep '<scenario>' --steps`. Use **codeceptjs-run-analysis** to verify the trace looks right after the fix — and to confirm the failure didn't shift to another step. If the fix introduces a `waitFor*` or `step.opts`, leave a one-line `Why:` comment — those are the comments worth keeping.

| Verify a locator against a saved trace snapshot (offline)     | `codeceptq <locator> --file output/trace_*/<NNNN>_<step>_page.html`            |

## Waiting (a common cause of flakes)

Most "intermittent" failures are missed waits. Use the trace HTML / ARIA to find the _actual_ gating element rather than adding a generic delay:

- a **loader / spinner / skeleton** still on the page → `I.waitForInvisible('.spinner')` / `I.waitForDetached('.skeleton')`
- a **modal / drawer / panel** that hasn't appeared yet → `I.waitForVisible('.modal')` / `I.waitForElement({ role: 'dialog' })`
- async data — list rows, cards, charts, async-rendered text → `I.waitForElement('.user-row', 10)` / `I.waitForText('Loaded', 10, '.status')`

`I.wait(N)` (raw seconds) is fine **during debugging** to confirm a timing hypothesis — if a 5-second sleep makes the test pass, you've found the cause. **Replace it with the specific `I.waitFor*` before committing.** Raw sleeps are slow on fast machines, flaky on slow ones, and hide the real sync point so the next person to touch the test inherits the same problem.

## Inspect the page when the trace isn't enough

When the trace tells you _what_ failed but you need more page-state detail to diagnose — "is this button actually disabled?", "are there really two Save buttons?", "what's the rendered markup of this row?" — hand off to the **codeceptjs-exploration** skill. It covers the WebElement API (`I.grabWebElement` / `I.grabWebElements`, state checks, `toSimplifiedHTML`, `toAbsoluteXPath`, iframe walking) and the broad-XPath candidate-discovery technique.

Debug-specific reaches into that toolkit:

- **Button rendered but the click had no effect** — `grabWebElement('Submit')`, then `isEnabled()` + `getBoundingBox()`. Disabled? offscreen? zero-sized?
- **Strict-mode "matched 2 elements"** — exploration's broad-XPath + iterate-and-disambiguate pattern is the canonical fix.
- **Iframe content** — exploration's `inIframe` pattern; the failing step likely needs to be wrapped in `within({ frame })`.

Prefer this over `usePlaywrightTo` / `useWebDriverTo` for inspection: same code across helpers, less boilerplate.

## Query trace HTML with `codeceptq`

`aiTrace` writes a per-step `<NNNN>_<step>_page.html` snapshot of the live DOM for every step (formatted so each element sits on its own line — line numbers map 1:1 to elements). To answer "would my locator have matched at step N?", use `codeceptq` — a CLI that resolves any CodeceptJS locator (CSS / XPath / fuzzy / semantic) against a saved HTML snapshot and prints the matched elements with their source lines.

**Never load the page HTML into your context to inspect it manually.** Real-world `*_page.html` files are thousands of lines and burn context for nothing — `codeceptq` does the locator resolution and returns only the relevant elements. Reach for it instead of `Read`-ing the snapshot.

```bash
# does this CSS resolve?
npx codeceptq '#submit-btn' --file output/trace_<TestName>_<hash>/0007_I_click_Submit_page.html

# semantic field lookup against a saved snapshot
npx codeceptq 'Email' --field --file output/trace_*/0003_*_page.html

# semantic clickable, scoped to a context
npx codeceptq 'Save' '.modal' --click --file output/trace_*/0005_*_page.html

# pipe directly from stdin
cat output/trace_*/0001_*_page.html | npx codeceptq './/form//input[@required]'

# machine-readable for chained tooling
npx codeceptq 'Username' --field --json --file output/trace_*/0002_*_page.html
```

What you get back: a count, the resolved XPath, and one entry per match with the **line number** in the snapshot file plus the element's outerHTML.

Flags worth knowing:

- `--field` / `--click` / `--checkable` / `--select` — force a CodeceptJS semantic strategy (label, button text, checkbox, option). Without a flag, the locator type is auto-detected (CSS if it starts with `#`/`.`/`[`; XPath if it starts with `//` or `./`; fuzzy text otherwise).
- `--xpath` / `--css` — force interpretation when auto-detection wouldn't pick the right one (e.g., a bare tag name like `select.foo` without `--css` would be treated as fuzzy text).
- `[context]` — second positional arg restricts matches to descendants of the context locator (e.g., `'Save' '.modal' --click`).
- `--limit N` (default 20), `--snippet N` (default 500), `--full`, `--json`.
- Exit codes: `0` matches, `1` no match, `2` invalid input/XPath — useful for scripted "did this locator break?" checks.

Use `codeceptq` to test locators against the snapshot **before** applying them via `run_code`. If a candidate matches, you've validated the locator string against the DOM as captured. It can still fail live — element not visible, removed by a re-render, or the snapshot is from a different step — so treat a hit as a green light to try, not a guarantee.

When `codeceptq` returns multiple matches, **don't write a brittler XPath** — disambiguate with `step.opts({ elementIndex })`. Indexing is 1-based and follows the order `codeceptq` prints; supports `'first'`, `'last'`, and negatives.

```js
I.click("Edit", step.opts({ elementIndex: 2 }));
I.fillField("input", "value", step.opts({ elementIndex: "last" }));
```

## Native helper API escape hatch

When `I.grabWebElement` and the rest of the `I.*` surface still don't cover it — listening to network requests, manipulating storage, calling a Playwright-only API, raw browser context work — drop down to the underlying helper:

- **Playwright** — `I.usePlaywrightTo('description', async ({ browser, browserContext, page }) => { ... })`
- **Puppeteer** — `I.usePuppeteerTo('description', async ({ page }) => { ... })`
- **WebDriver** — `I.useWebDriverTo('description', async ({ browser }) => { ... })`

The first arg is a label that shows up in step output and traces. The callback receives the helper's native objects. Use these to inspect or manipulate state CodeceptJS doesn't expose — `page.evaluate(() => performance.timing)`, `page.context().cookies()`, `browserContext.on('request', …)`, raw `executeScript` chains. They work inside MCP `run_code` too, so you can poke at internals during a live debug session.

Try the regular `I.*` API first — these escape hatches couple the test to a specific helper. Reach for them only when nothing else works.

## Helper-specific gotchas

- **Playwright** — `strict: true` throws on multi-match. `trace: 'on'` produces `output/trace.zip` (open with `npx playwright show-trace`). Prefer `'load'` / `'domcontentloaded'` over `'networkidle'`.
- **Puppeteer** — `'networkidle0'` can hang on long-polling pages; try `'networkidle2'` or `'domcontentloaded'`.
- **WebDriver** — `smartWait` applies to actions only, not assertions. `executeScript` args must be JSON-serializable.

## Auth-related failures

If the trace shows a redirect to `/login` mid-test, or 401/403 in console, fix **auth**, not the failing step. Check the `auth` plugin's `check`, that credential env vars are exported, and that the cached session under `output/<role>_session.json` isn't stale (delete it to force re-login). The **codeceptjs-auth** skill has the full pattern.

## Things to avoid

- Fixing from the error message without reading the trace.
- Editing the test before verifying the fix in `run_code` — you'll iterate without ground truth.
- Committing `pause()` calls. They're a debugging tool — remove (or replace with `pauseAt`) before merging. A `pause()` left in a test that runs in a non-TTY non-MCP CI subprocess will print a notice and skip, but it's still noise on every run.
- Adding `waitFor*` blindly instead of identifying the real gating element from HTML/ARIA.
- Leaving `I.wait(N)` (raw seconds) in committed tests — keep them only while debugging, then replace with the specific `waitFor*`.
- Editing `aiTrace`'s `on:` in `codecept.conf.js` to switch capture modes — declare it once and override per-run with `-p aiTrace:on=...`. Repeated config edits churn the repo and leak the mode into unrelated runs.
- Skipping the config check — `setHeadlessWhen(CI)` or env-driven URLs explain many "works locally fails in CI" reports.
- Hiding the failure with `retries` instead of fixing the cause.
